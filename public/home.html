            “It must be borne in mind that the tragedy of life
            doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy
            lies in having no goals to reach.”

            "In the diary you find proof that in situations which
            today would seem unbearable, you lived, looked around
            and wrote down observations, that this right hand moved"
            then as it does today.

            "If there was no other motive in view [except] to have the
            privilege of reading over out journals and for our children
            to read, it would pay for the time spent in writing it."
